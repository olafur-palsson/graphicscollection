1. It would be best to use triangles since we only have to code
   for one shape. We can for example approximate the sphere by
   using longitude and latitude by for example:
      a. Start at the bottom, draw point.
      b. Move up n degrees latitude, then
         travelling fixed length along the
         circumference of the sphere.
      c. Repeat b. until at top.
   With this method we then draw an edge between the closest two
   vertices of the graph while never crossing two lines (wrt surface).

   Then we have a sphere approximation with only triangles.

2. Bandwidth_HD = 3 * 1920 * 1080 * 60 = 3.7 * 10^8
   Bandwidth_UHD = 3 * 3840 * 2160 * 60 = 1.4 * 10^9

3. Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 Ti
   
   Mem_bandwidth     = 256 GB/s
   Pixel_fill_rate   = 92.3 GP/s
   Bus_int_bandwidth = 15.8 GB/s

   Last depends on what framerate is acceptable.
   Assume 60Hz we have:
      92.3 GP/s
    ->1.53 GP at 60Hz
    ->Aspect ration 16:9 gives 16*9 'zones'
    ->10682 pixels per 'zone'
    ->each 'zone' is 103x103 in dimension.

    ->Max resolution supported is then roughly ~1600x900
